Privacy Policy for Tip Calculator

Tip Calculator ("the Application") is an Android application developed by SLTGK that helps users to easily calculate a tip amount for your bill when in restaurants (not limited to).
This privacy policy explains what information is collected when you use the Application and how that information is handled.

1. Data the Application Does Not Collect or Transmit

   The Application is designed to function entirely offline.
   It does not access or use your device's internet connection for any functionality.
   It does not collect, use, store, or share any personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, location, contacts, or photos.
   No information created by or stored in the Application is transmitted to the developer or any other third party. All user data is stored locally on your device.

2. Data Collected by Google Play for Crash Reporting

   To help improve the stability and performance of the Application, we use the Google Play Console crash reporting feature.
   When a user has opted-in to automatically share usage and diagnostics data with Google at the Android system level, Google's services will automatically collect anonymized crash logs and other diagnostic information when the Application unexpectedly crashes.
   This information is collected by Google and then provided to us in an aggregated and anonymized format through the Google Play Console.
   The data we receive includes technical information such as:
   Stack traces from the app's code that help pinpoint the source of the crash.
   Information about your device (e.g., model, OS version).
   Other diagnostic data related to the crash event.
   We use this data solely for debugging purposes and fixing stability issues. This process helps ensure a smoother, more reliable experience for all users.
   For more information on how Google handles this data, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy. 

3. Third-Party Access

    The Application does not share any user data with third parties.
    As stated above, any diagnostic data is handled by Google's services, which then provides an anonymized version to us.

4. Permissions

   The Application only requests the absolute minimum permissions necessary for its core, offline functionality. It does not request internet access or any permissions that would access personal or sensitive user data.

5. Your Consent

   By using the Application, you consent to this privacy policy.

6. Contact Us
